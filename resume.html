        <h3><strong>Tecan</strong> 12/2014-04/2016</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Designed and developed 3rd party drivers (C#) that allow customers to utilize
                Tecan instrumentation in conjunction with third party devices</li> 
            <li>Designed and developed custom software (C#, VBscript) for advanced worklist 
                generatiors</li>
            <li>Developed applications for fully-integrated systems including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Compound Management Platform for cherrypicking, re-arraying and serial 
                        dilutions. System included Carousel storage for 220 plates, various hotels, 
                        LiHa, Multichannel head 384, Robotic Manipulator, XPeel, PlateLock sealer, 
                        Symbol scanner and Pos-ID. Integration included installation, driver set-up and 
                        development of numerous scripts according to customer specifications.</li>
                    <li>DNA pooling and normalization platform. System required capping/decapping of matrix tuberacks utilizing pick and place arm and pneumatic vial 
                        gripper. Application setup included full integration with LIMS</li>
                    <li>High throughput ELISA system. Protocols were developed utilizing scheduling 
                        software EvoWare PLUS. System was integrated with Hydrofelx platewasher 
                        and Sunrise platereader. Sample IDs in reader output files were set-up to 
                        automatically import from Pos-ID barcodes.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Design scripts for Tissue Culture System for Single Cell Cloning. System included Cellavista 
                cell imager which allowed to observe colony growth over a period of 14 days. 
                Application set-up included scripts for feeding, sampling and imaging based on 
                customer worklist.</li>            
        </ul>
